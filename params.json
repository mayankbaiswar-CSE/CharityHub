{"name":"Charityhub","tagline":"Connecting organisations to people.","body":"### Welcome to CharityHub.\r\nThis project was made to keep in mind all the troubles organisations go through to reach out to people. Therefore, CharityHub makes it really easy for organisations to reach out to all the generous donors.\r\n\r\n### How This is done?\r\nThe project contains a web app as well as this mobile app.The web app will be uploaded on GitHub very soon. While this mobile app solely for donors or the common people, the web app is for the organisations to register themselves as well as keep posting about their needs.\r\nThe mobile app (for now Android, soon for iOS) is used to keep in touch with the organisations and see their needs. You can donate with the help of the app itself. The app will be giving you any latest notifications from any of the registered organisations.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nThe mobile app was made by @mayankbaiswar-CSE, while the web app was made by [Kartik Agarwal](https://www.facebook.com/kartik.agarwal.01) and [Prakhar Tiwari](https://www.facebook.com/prakhar.tiwari.9678).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with app?\r\nContact me [anytime](https://twitter.com/mayankbaiswar), for hugs and bugs.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
