# CharityHub
Connecting organisations to people.

This project is made to make sure those organisations are not left out which can surely utilise some generous donations from people.
It comes with a web and a mobile app. The web app is used by the organisations to register themselves.
While this mobile app can be used by anyone, to donate or just to enquire the needs of any organisations. With the help of this app -

* you can see all the needs of an organisation.
* you can donate whatever you like.
* you can search the organisations by location or by number of beneficiaries.
* you can search organisations near you.
